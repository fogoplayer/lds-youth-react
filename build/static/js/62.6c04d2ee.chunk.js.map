Take\n      advantage of every opportunity to let the young men talk about their\n      experiences. Sharing is not something the young men do once, and it does\n      not represent the completion of their plan. It does not need to be done in\n      a formal setting; it can be most effective in informal conversations\n      during quorum activities, with friends, and with family members.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>For The Strength of Youth</h5>\n    <p>\n      After the young men have begun working on their plans in “Spiritual\n      Strength” and “Priesthood Duties,” they have the opportunity to create a\n      project based on some of the standards in For the Strength of Youth.\n      Priests are invited to create an additional project to help them prepare\n      to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and serve a full-time mission. The\n      young men should have a parent or leader approve their project before they\n      begin. You can help them create a project that is challenging but also\n      based on their needs and interests.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Review Their Progress</h4>\n    <p>\n      The best way to help a young man see the progress he is making is to have\n      frequent conversations with him about his plans and his experiences.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At least one of these conversations should happen as the young man\n      approaches the age to be ordained to an office in the priesthood. During\n      this conversation, ask him to review the plans he made as a deacon,\n      teacher, or priest. Talk about how fulfilling those plans has helped him\n      prepare for the additional priesthood duties he is about to receive. This\n      is an opportunity to help the young man reflect on the kind of priesthood\n      holder he is becoming. At the end of each “Spiritual Strength” and\n      “Priesthood Duties” section is a “Review” section. Here you and the young\n      man can indicate with your signatures that you have had this conversation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Completing the activities in this book is not a requirement for advancing\n      in the priesthood. The purpose of the activities is to help young men\n      prepare for priesthood service.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Duty to God Certificates</h4>\n    <p>\n      After you have completed the “Review” sections, and after the young man\n      has completed his “For the Strength of Youth” project, he is eligible to\n      receive a Duty to God certificate. Three certificates are available: one\n      each for deacons (item number 08686), teachers (08687), and priests\n      (08688). These certificates acknowledge the progress the young man is\n      making toward fulfilling his duty to God. To receive the priest\n      certificate, the young man must also complete his project in the section\n      titled “Preparing to Receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.” It is not\n      necessary that he receive the deacon and teacher certificates in order to\n      receive the priest certificate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The certificates are awarded under the direction of the bishop. An\n      optional plaque for displaying the priest certificate is also available\n      (08694).\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Use the Duty To God Program To Strengthen The Quorum</h4>\n    <p>The Duty to God program strengthens the quorum by: </p>\n    <ol>\n      <li>\n        <b>Helping quorum members understand their duty to God. </b> For\n        example, you can help quorum members understand their duties by having\n        them complete the learning activities in this book as a quorum.\n        Counseling together about priesthood duties and spiritual growth can\n        broaden their understanding and inspire them to act.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>\n          Providing opportunities for quorum members to work together in\n          fulfilling priesthood duties.{\" \"}\n        </b>In some cases, quorum members can counsel together to make their\n        plans, and they can carry out their plans together. Doing this allows\n        them to support and encourage each other.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Encouraging quorum members to share ideas and experiences. </b> Some\n        of the younger quorum members may have difficulty thinking of plans;\n        sharing ideas as a quorum can help generate more ideas. Sharing\n        experiences with quorum members can help build faith, testimony, and\n        quorum brotherhood. Consider doing this regularly during quorum meetings\n        and activities.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>\n          Providing the quorum president the opportunity to lead by example.{\" \"}\n        </b>When a young man joins the quorum, the quorum president could use\n        the Duty to God book to help the new quorum member understand his\n        duties. The quorum president could also share with the quorum the plans\n        he has made in his own book and tell about his experiences carrying out\n        those plans.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>Helping quorum members learn the importance of priesthood keys.</b>{\" \"}\n        The quorum president holds the keys of presidency for his quorum (see{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.142-143\">\n          D&C 124:142–43\n        </a>). Quorum advisers should allow him the opportunity to exercise\n        those keys. As young men serve together under the direction of the\n        quorum president, they can grow in their understanding of how the Lord\n        works through priesthood leaders. They can see that a quorum is a\n        divinely appointed organization that gives them opportunities to learn\n        their priesthood duties, give priesthood service, and grow spiritually.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h4>Use the Duty To God Program to Strengthen Relationships</h4>\n    <p>\n      When you have a strong relationship with your son or the young men in your\n      quorum, they are more likely to deepen their conversion to the gospel and\n      remain faithful. The activities in the Duty to God book provide an\n      excellent opportunity to strengthen these relationships. For example,\n      making your own plans and working on them with your son or a quorum member\n      could allow you to spend time together engaged in meaningful activities.\n      Sharing experiences with each other gives you the opportunity to bear\n      testimony and strengthen each other spiritually\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Page;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/pages/duty-to-god/to-quorum-advisers-and-parents.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
