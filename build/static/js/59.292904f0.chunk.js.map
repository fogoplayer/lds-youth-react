Stake\n      presidents should regularly ask bishops about the welfare and progress of\n      the young women in their wards.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Guidelines</h4>\n\n    <p>\n      The goals and requirements of the program are outlined in the front of\n      this book. The following additional guidelines may be helpful for leaders.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Value Experiences</h5>\n\n    <p>A young woman may work on the values in any order.</p>\n    <p>\n      With the exception of the value of virtue, young women are encouraged to\n      complete the required value experiences before doing the project for that\n      value.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Value Projects</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      A value project is intended to help a young woman apply what she has\n      learned from the value experiences.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A young woman should spend a minimum of ten hours for each value project.\n      The same ten hours may not count for more than one value project.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Young women may work together on projects. However, a young woman must\n      spend a minimum of ten hours of her own time if she is using that project\n      to fulfill her own Personal Progress requirement.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With the prior approval of parents or Young Women leaders, the good things\n      young women are doing at home, Church, school, seminary, and in the\n      community may fulfill the requirements of Personal Progress.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Completing Personal Progress</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      When a young woman completes the Personal Progress requirements before\n      leaving Young Women, she should be invited to help other young women who\n      are still working on Personal Progress. She should also be encouraged to\n      earn an Honor Bee or begin the program again.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If a young woman has not completed all of the Personal Progress\n      requirements before leaving Young Women, she should be encouraged to\n      continue working toward receiving the Young Womanhood Recognition.\n      Mothers, leaders, and other exemplary women may be invited to support her\n      in accomplishing this.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Tracking and Pacing</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      The <a href=\"recordSheet.html\">Personal Progress Record Sheet</a>{\" \"}\n      summarizes each young woman's work in Personal Progress.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A Young Women Personal Progress Tracking Sheet for Leaders is also\n      available as a separate sheet to assist leaders in tracking the progress\n      of each young woman (36655). It can be used to assist both Young Women and\n      priesthood leaders in working with and recognizing each young woman.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Young women may work at their own pace in the Personal Progress program;\n      however, it is recommended that a young woman complete at least one value\n      experience each month and one value project every six months (two a year).\n      If she starts working when she enters Young Women at age 12 and continues\n      at this suggested pace, she will finish when she is 16. She will then have\n      two years to{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"honorBee.html\">earn an Honor Bee or begin the program again</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Recognizing Individual Progress</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      When a young woman completes the experiences and projects for each value,\n      she receives an emblem (36654) and the scripture ribbon associated with\n      that value. She places the emblem on the Personal Progress Value\n      Achievement page of her book (page 78). She uses the ribbon as a bookmark\n      in her scriptures. This recognition of her progress can be awarded in a\n      Young Women meeting.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Annually, at Young Women in Excellence, young women should be recognized\n      for their accomplishments.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A young woman's success in Personal Progress may also be acknowledged as\n      she receives her Beehive, Mia Maid, and Laurel certificates as she moves\n      from class to class. These certificates (Beehive, 08563; Mia Maid, 08565;\n      Laurel, 08564) are awarded under the direction of the bishop. They\n      acknowledge the young woman's movement from one age-group to another.\n    </p>\n\n    <h5>Young Womanhood Recognition</h5>\n\n    <p>\n      When a young woman completes her work in all eight values and has been\n      interviewed by the bishop, she receives the Young Womanhood Recognition.\n      This recognition consists of a certificate (36651) and a medallion in\n      either gold or silver (gold, 08602; silver, 08603). A member of the\n      bishopric may present the Young Womanhood Recognition in a sacrament\n      meeting.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After completing the Young Womanhood Recognition, a young woman may\n      continue to progress by earning an{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"honorBee.html\">Honor Bee charm</a> (gold, 08562; silver, 08578).\n      This recognition of her progress can be awarded in a Young Women meeting.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Awards and certificates may be obtained through a Church distribution\n      center using ward funds, at no cost to the young women or their parents.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Personal Progress Requirements for Leaders</h4>\n\n    <p>\n      Leaders are encouraged to work on Personal Progress along with the young\n      women. Those who participate in the Personal Progress program themselves\n      understand the program better and set a favorable example for the young\n      women to follow. They may earn the Young Womanhood Recognition after they:\n    </p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Serve for a total of one year as a Young Women leader.</li>\n      <li>\n        Complete the required value experiences in each of the eight values.\n      </li>\n      <li>Complete three value projects, including the project for virtue.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h4>Participation of Mothers</h4>\n\n    <p>\n      Mothers are welcome to participate with young women in earning the Young\n      Womanhood Recognition. Mothers work from their own Personal Progress book\n      and may earn the recognition along with their daughter. It is recommended\n      that a daughter earn her recognition before or along with her mother.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mothers may complete the same requirements as their daughters, including:\n    </p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Attend sacrament meeting regularly (where possible).</li>\n      <li>\n        Live the standards in{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth\">\n          For the Strength of Youth\n        </a>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Complete the value experiences and value project for each of the eight\n        values.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Keep a <a href=\"myJournal.html\">personal journal</a>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Read the <a href=\"https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/\">Book of Mormon</a>{\" \"}\n        regularly.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"myTestimony.html\">Record her testimony</a> of the Savior Jesus\n        Christ.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>\n      Mothers may select different options for the elective value experiences\n      and the value projects from their daughters. The experiences and projects\n      may be signed and dated by their daughter, their spouse, a Young Women\n      leader, or another adult. The bishop verifies that the requirements have\n      been completed. Recognition and the purchase of recognition materials\n      should be coordinated with Young Women leaders and the bishopric.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>\n      Personal Progress Requirements for Others Who Desire to Work on the\n      Program\n    </h4>\n\n    <p>\n      Other women who desire to participate in and complete Personal Progress\n      may do so by completing the same requirements as young women and by\n      assisting a young woman with a portion of her Personal Progress. (See\n      requirements for mothers)\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Incorporating Personal Progress in Sunday Lessons and at Mutual</h4>\n\n    <p>\n      Working together on a Personal Progress experience as part of a Sunday\n      lesson can give leaders and young women an opportunity to discuss the\n      principles being taught and their application in the lives of young women.\n      References to Personal Progress can be found in Young Women curriculum\n      materials.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      Personal Progress activities may also be part of Mutual. For example, all\n      young women could assist with one young woman's value project. Working\n      together on a project can help motivate young women to continue\n      progressing. Such group activities should be planned prayerfully and\n      selectively to ensure that the Personal Progress program remains personal\n      for each young woman.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4>Adapting to Individual and Local Needs</h4>\n\n    <p>\n      Value experiences and value projects may be adapted according to personal\n      or local circumstances, interests, and needs with prior approval of\n      parents and leaders. When making any changes or exceptions for one person,\n      leaders should consider the effect those changes may have on other young\n      women. After careful consideration by parents and leaders, adaptations may\n      be made to meet the needs of young women with disabilities or educational\n      limitations, to meet cultural or individual needs, or to allow young women\n      who are not members to participate.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      If a young woman joins the Church or becomes active in Young Women after\n      age 16, her requirements for completing the Personal Progress program are\n      to:\n    </p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Attend sacrament meeting regularly (where possible).</li>\n      <li>\n        Live the standards in{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth\">\n          For the Strength of Youth\n        </a>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Complete the required value experiences in each of the eight values.\n        (She need not complete the elective experiences.)\n      </li>\n      <li>Complete a value project in each of the eight values.</li>\n      <li>Attend seminary (where available).</li>\n      <li>\n        Read the <a href=\"https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/\">Book of Mormon</a>{\" \"}\n        regularly.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"myTestimony.html\">Record her testimony</a> of the Savior Jesus\n        Christ.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>\n      These requirements may also apply to young women in other circumstances as\n      determined by local Young Women leaders.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default Page;\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/pages/personal-progress/overview-for-parents-and-leaders.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
