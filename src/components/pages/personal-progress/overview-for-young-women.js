    <h2>Overview For Young Women</h2>

    <h4>Overview of Personal Progress </h4>

    <p>
      Personal Progress will help you strengthen your faith in and testimony of
      Jesus Christ as you learn His teachings and regularly apply them in your
      life. It will help you strengthen both your present family and your future
      family. It will help you prepare to make and keep sacred covenants and
      receive the ordinances of the temple. And it will prepare you to be a
      faithful, contributing member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
      Saints.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Personal Progress program uses the eight Young Women values to help
      you understand more fully who you are, why you are here on the earth, and
      what you should be doing as a daughter of God to prepare for the day you
      go to the temple to make sacred covenants. It will help you prepare for
      your future roles as a faithful woman, wife, mother, and leader in God's
      kingdom. Participating in Personal Progress teaches you to make
      commitments, carry them out, and report your progress to a parent or
      leader. The patterns you establish as you work on Personal Progress-such
      as prayer, scripture study, service, and journal keeping-will become
      personal daily habits. These habits will strengthen your testimony and
      help you learn and improve throughout your life.
    </p>

        of the Savior Jesus Christ.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      After finishing these requirements, you will be eligible to receive the
      Young Womanhood Recognition following a worthiness interview with your
      bishop or branch president.
    </p>

    <h4>Getting Started</h4>

    <p>
      You may begin working on the Personal Progress program at age 12 or at the
      time of your baptism if you are between the ages of 12 and 18. Young women
      who are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are
      also welcome to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you begin, you will receive a torch necklace with the Young Women torch
      logo on it. Wearing this necklace signifies your commitment to hold up
      your light and stand for truth and righteousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Invite your parents to help you in planning and completing the Personal
      Progress program. Sharing these experiences can strengthen your
      relationship with them. Your mother or another exemplary woman may work on
      Personal Progress with you, and you may earn your Young Womanhood
      Recognition together. You may adapt experiences and projects according to
      your personal circumstances, interests, and needs with the prior approval
      of a parent, a Young Women leader, or another adult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personal Progress can be part of the good things you are doing at home,
      church, school, seminary, and in the community. Use the subject index in
      the back of this book to find specific topics you are interested in and to
      learn how they can be used as part of Personal Progress. Remember to give
      yourself credit for all the good things you do each day. "By small and
      simple things are great things brought to pass" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.6">
        Alma 37:6
      </a>).
    </p>

    <h4>Guidelines</h4>

    <p>
      You will complete six experiences (three required and three elective) and
      one ten-hour project in each of the first seven Young Women values. For
      the value of virtue, you will complete four required experiences and the
      required project of reading the Book of Mormon. You may begin with any
      value and work in any order.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you have completed a value experience or a value project, review it
      with a parent, a leader, or another adult. Have that person initial the
      completed experience in your Personal Progress book. Keep a record of your
      progress on the{" "}
      <a href="/personal-progress/personal-progress-record-sheet">
        Personal Progress Record Sheet
      </a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Value Experiences</h5>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you complete the required experiences in a value
      before moving on to the elective experiences in that value.
    </p>

    <p>
      With elective value experiences, you may write up to two of your own
      experiences in each value or adapt the provided experiences to fit your
      personal interests, goals, or circumstances. Have a parent, a leader, or
      another adult approve these before you begin.
    </p>

    <h5>Value Projects</h5>

    <p>
      Complete the required experiences in a value before starting the project
      in that value, with the exception of the value of virtue. You may begin
      reading the Book of Mormon at any time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have a parent, a leader, or another adult approve each value project
      before you begin.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may invite others to help you with your value projects, but each
      project must take a minimum of ten hours of your own time.
    </p>

    <h5>Pacing and Recognition</h5>

    <p>
      You may work at your own pace, but you should always be working on at
      least one experience or project. The following is recommended:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Complete at least one experience a month and one project every six
        months (two projects a year).
      </li>
      <li>
        Regularly attend sacrament meeting and participate in seminary (where
        possible).
      </li>
      <li>
        Meet with a member of your bishopric at least annually to discuss your
        success in Personal Progress, your efforts to live the standards in For
        the Strength of Youth, and any other questions you may have.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      When all of the experiences and the project in a value are completed, your
      leader will recognize your accomplishment in a Young Women meeting and
      present you with an emblem to be placed on your Personal Progress Value
      Achievement page in your booklet (page 78) and a ribbon to be placed in
      your scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will have the opportunity to share your accomplishments in Personal
      Progress annually at Young Women in Excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your success in Personal Progress may also be noted when you receive your
      Beehive, Mia Maid, and Laurel certificates as you move from class to
      class.
    </p>

    <h5>Completing Personal Progress</h5>

    <p>
      When you have completed all of the Personal Progress value experiences and
      projects, record your testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ{" "}
      <a href="/personal-progress/my-testimony">here</a>. Review the "<a href="/personal-progress/young-womanhood-recognition">
        Young Womanhood Recognition
      </a>" section of this book with a parent, a leader, or another adult. Then
      schedule an interview with your bishop so he can sign the{" "}
      <a href="../personal-progress/reccomendation-for-young-women">
        recommendation
      </a>{" "}
      and arrange for presenting your Young Womanhood Recognition certificate
      and medallion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is recommended that you work on Personal Progress throughout your time
      in Young Women, even after you have earned the Young Womanhood
      Recognition. Suggestions on how to continue progressing are in the section
      "<a href="/personal-progress/what-do-i-do-when-i-complete-personal-progress">
        What Do I Do When I Complete Personal Progress?
      </a>". Review this with a parent, a leader, or another adult. You may
      choose to earn an Honor Bee charm to place on your necklace with your
      medallion, or you may begin the entire program again. You are also
      encouraged to help other young women with their Personal Progress. By
      continuing your progress, you will stay on the path to the temple and
      develop qualities that will help you throughout your life.
