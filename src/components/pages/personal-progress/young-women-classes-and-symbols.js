    <h2>Young Women Classes and Symbols</h2>

    <h4>
      Beehive, <i>ages 12 and 13</i>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The beehive was a symbol of harmony, cooperation, and work for the early
      pioneers of the Church. Beehive was also the first name by which young
      women were known. Beehives today learn to work together in cooperation and
      harmony as they strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ and prepare to
      stand for truth and righteousness. This is a time to "arise and shine
      forth" (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115.5">
        D&C 115:5
      </a>).
    </p>

    <h4>
      Mia Maid, <i>ages 14 and 15</i>
    </h4>
    <p>
      The name Mia Maid refers historically to the Mutual Improvement
      Association, which adopted the emblem of the rose as a symbol of love,
      faith, and purity. Mia Maids today learn about love, faith, and purity as
      they strengthen their testimony and accept and act upon the Young Women
      values.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Laurel, <i>ages 16 and 17</i>
    </h4>
    <p>
      For centuries the laurel wreath has been a crown woven from the leaves of
      the laurel tree. It is given to someone who finishes a significant
      achievement as a symbol of honor and accomplishment. Laurels today are
      finishing their preparation to make and keep sacred covenants and receive
      the ordinances of the temple.
