      "Give me a young woman who loves home and family, who reads and ponders
      the scriptures daily, who has a burning testimony of the Book of Mormon.
      Give me a young woman who faithfully attends her church meetings, who is a
      seminary graduate, who has earned her Young Womanhood Recognition Award
      and wears it with pride! Give me a young woman who is virtuous and who has
      maintained her personal purity, who will not settle for less than a temple
      marriage, and I will give you a young woman who will perform miracles for
      the Lord now and throughout eternity."
