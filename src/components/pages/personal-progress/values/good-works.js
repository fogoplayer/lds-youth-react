        Others often give service you may not notice, such as preparing meals,
        reading to or listening to younger children, repairing clothing, or
        helping a brother or sister. For two weeks record in your journal the
        quiet acts of service your family members and others perform.
        Acknowledge their service in some meaningful way.

        Service is an essential principle of family living. Help plan your
        family's menus, obtain the food, and prepare part of the meals for two
        weeks. During that time help your family gather to share mealtimes.
        Report to your class what you have learned.

        them bear their burdens. Do the things on your list, and tell a family
        member or leader about the experience and how your attitude and
        understanding have changed.

    <h4 class="yellow-text text-darken-1">Additional Value Experiences</h4>
    <p>
      Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
      following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
      must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
      or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.

        Teach a lesson about service in family home evening or in another
        setting. Use pictures, music, examples, or demonstrations in your
        lesson. You may want to use the manual{" "}

        apply this scripture in her family. Develop a pattern of service in your
        life by choosing a family member you can help. Serve that person for at
        least a month. Record in your journal your actions and feelings about
        how this improved your relationship with that person.

      <li>
        Spend at least three hours giving service outside your family. Ask your
        ward or branch Relief Society president or a community leader for
        suggestions for service. For example, you might take care of children
        while parents attend the temple; collect, make, or recondition toys or
        games for a nursery; accept an assignment to clean the meetinghouse; or
        perform errands for or read to a homebound person or others in need.
        Record in your journal the reactions of the person you served and
        possible goals for future service opportunities.

        Through your good works, others will see your example and may want to
        know more about the gospel. Pray for a missionary experience. Read{" "}

        less active to go with you to a Church meeting or activity. Introduce
        your friend to others, and make sure he or she is involved. Share your
        testimony of the gospel, and invite him or her to come again.

    <h4 class="yellow-text text-darken-1">Value Project</h4>

    <p>
      After you have completed six good works value experiences, create a
      project that will help you practice what you have learned. This should be
      a significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
      Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
      project.
    </p>
    <p>Have your parent or leader approve the project before you begin. Write an evaluation after you finish. Below are some ideas for a value project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help plan and participate in a project to clean or beautify your community. </li>
        <li>Prepare to be a homemaker by collecting recipes, shopping for food, and preparing meals for your family. </li>
        <li>Work with a family member to gather the names of some deceased relatives who were not members of the Church. Identify their birth and death dates and prepare their names to be taken to the temple. Help plan a temple trip and do baptisms for those relatives. </li>
        <li>Prepare to serve others by receiving training for a skill to use in emergency situations, such as first aid, resuscitation, or lifesaving skills. </li>
        <li>Serve others. Volunteer in the community, gather items to meet humanitarian needs, spend extended time assisting with child or elderly care, or tutor in school or in your community.</li>
