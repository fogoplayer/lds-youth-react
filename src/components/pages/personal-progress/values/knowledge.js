        budgeting, time management, cooking, sewing, or child care). Share with

      <li>
        Select a gospel principle you would like to understand better (for
        example, faith, repentance, charity, eternal families, or baptismal
        covenants). Read scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets that
        relate to the principle. Prepare a five-minute talk on the subject and
        give the talk in a sacrament meeting, in a Young Women meeting, to your
        family, or to your class. Record in your journal how you can apply this
        gospel principle in your life.

        someone who works in that field and find out what that persons job
        responsibilities are, what training or education the person obtained to
        do the job, and what contributions this persons job makes to society.
        Record your findings in your journal.

        At Young Women camp you learn skills in first aid, safety, sanitation,
        and survival. Review these teachings in your Young Women Camp Manual and
        note in your journal how you could apply them in your home to keep your
        family safe. Develop a list of basic supplies your family will need in
        case of an emergency. Teach a family home evening lesson or share with a
        Young Women leader what you have learned and what additional skills you
        would like to learn to be prepared for emergencies.

    <h4 class="green-text">Value Project</h4>

    <p>
      After you have completed six knowledge value experiences, create a project
      that will help you practice what you have learned. This should be a
      significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
      Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
      project.
    </p>
    <p>Have your parent or leader approve the project before you begin. Write an evaluation after you finish. Below are some ideas for a value project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learn how to organize, clean, and maintain a home from your mother, grandmother, or another woman you admire. Then apply what you have learned in your home. </li>
        <li>Prepare for higher education and obtaining marketable skills by learning about college or trade school entrance requirements, scholarships, and tuition and other expenses. Apply for entrance when appropriate. </li>
        <li>Read <a href="https://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88">Doctrine and Covenants 89</a>. Consider what you can do to be more physically fit. Improve your health by developing and implementing a regular fitness program and learning to cook and eat food that is part of a healthful diet. </li>
        <li>Learn about the proper care of clothing, including how to wash, iron, and make basic repairs and alterations. Apply the skills you learned by taking care of your clothing. </li>
        <li>Working with your mother, grandmother, or a woman in your ward or branch, master a homemaking skill she teaches you.</li>
