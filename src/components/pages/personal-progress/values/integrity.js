        Integrity is the willingness and desire to live by our beliefs and
        standards. Read{" "}

        <a href="https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth">
          For the Strength of Youth
        </a>. Reflect on how the Lord's standards differ from the world's
        standards. Record in your journal appropriate standards for behavior,
        dress, and conversation, as well as literature, movies, television,
        Internet, music, cell phones, and other media. Also write your plan to
        stay morally clean and worthy to attend the temple. After keeping your
        standards for at least one month, record your feelings in your journal
        and continue to keep your commitment.

      <li>
        Conduct a self-assessment of your personal integrity. Ask yourself the
        following questions: Do I avoid gossip, inappropriate jokes, swearing
        and profanity, and being light-minded about sacred subjects? Am I
        completely truthful, morally clean, honest, dependable, and trustworthy
        in my schoolwork and other activities? Pray daily for strength and for
        the guidance of the Holy Ghost to help you live with integrity. Write in
        your journal the things you can do to improve your personal integrity
        and at least one new habit you want to develop.

        integrity. Think of a time when you had the courage to show integrity,
        especially when it was not easy or popular. Share your experience and
        your feelings about it in a testimony meeting or lesson or with a parent
        or leader.

    <h4 className="purple-text">Additional Value Experiences</h4>
    <p>
      Complete three additional value experiences. You may select from the
      following options or write up to two of your own. Your parent or leader
      must approve those you write yourself before you begin. Have your parent
      or leader sign and date each experience after you finish.
    </p>

    <ol start="4">
      <li>
        RLook up the word integrity in a dictionary. Interview your mother,
        grandmother, or another woman you respect about her understanding and
        application of the word. Make a list of ways you can ake your actions
        consistent with your knowledge of right and wrong, and record in your
        journal what it means to you to have integrity.

        <TextArea id="integrityGoal4" />

      <li>
        Learn about standing as a witness. Read{" "}
        <a href="https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9">Mosiah 18:9</a>.
        Then recor in your journal how you can personally "stand as [a witness]
        of God at all times and in all things, and in all places." Choose a
        personal behavior that you need to improve so you can be a better
        example. Develop integrity in your life as you practice your new
        behavior for three weeks. Record your progress in your journal.

        <TextArea id="integrityGoal5" />
      </li>

      <li>
        Living the law of the fast is an opportunity to practice integrity. On a
        designated fast Sunday, abstain from food and drink for two consecutive
        meals and contribute to your family's fast offering. Have a specific
        purpose in mind as you fast. You might fast for a sick friend, to
        overcome a bad habit, to obtain a special blessing for yourself or
        someone else, or to give thanks. Begin and close your fast with a
        prayer.
        <Signoff color="purple" id="integritySignoff6" />
      </li>

      <li>
        List the issues, trends, and problems that weaken the family. Read the
        First Presidency message, "<a href="proclamationToTheWorld.html">
          The Family: A Proclamation to the World
        </a>", and the{" "}
        <a href="https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/family">
          section on family in For the Strength of Youth
        </a>. Then research in the Church magazines the counsel of those whom we
        sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. Write in your journal your
        plan to strengthen your present family and the values and traditions you
        want to establish with your future family.

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4 className="purple-text">Value Project</h4>

    <p>
      After you have completed six integrity value experiences, create a project
      that will help you practice what you have learned. This should be a
      significant effort that will take at least ten hours to complete.
      Prayerfully seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost to select a meaningful
      project.
    </p>
    <p>Have your parent or leader approve the project before you begin. Write an evaluation after you finish. Below are some ideas for a value project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Record examples of ways family members have demonstrated the quality of integrity in their lives. </li>
        <li>Having integrity means keeping your commitments. Identify and keep your commitments to others as you participate as a member of a team or organization or in a leadership position in your school or community. </li>
        <li>Using 1 Timothy 4:12 as your guide, organize and carry out an activity that will help you practice being “an example of the believers.” </li>
        <li>Making and keeping temple covenants requires integrity. Prepare to make temple covenants by making and wearing an item of clothing that conforms with standards of modest dress as explained in the pamphlet For the Strength of Youth and in the words of living prophets. </li>
        <li>In talks given by General Authorities, research the topics of integrity and honesty. Learn why these principles are critical to your happiness and temple preparation. Create an object (such as a picture, a book of quotations, or a hand-stitched item) that will remind you each day of your commitment to be honest and true at all times and known for your personal integrity</li>
