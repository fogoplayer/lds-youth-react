        Virtue is a pattern of thought and behavior based on high moral
        standards. It includes chastity and purity. The power to create mortal
        life is an exalted power God has given His children. He has commanded
        that this power be used only between a man and a woman, lawfully wedded
        as husband and wife. Study the meaning and importance of chastity and
        virtue by reading{" "}

        Virtuous living at all times and in all things, and in all places
        qualifies you for the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. When you
        are baptized and confirmed, you are given the gift of the Holy Ghost to
        guide all aspects of your life. Since the Holy Ghost does not dwell in
        unclean tabernacles, living a virtuous life is a prerequisite to having
        the companionship of the Holy Ghost and receiving the blessings of
        temple ordinances. Read the following scripture references and identify
        the promised blessings:{" "}
