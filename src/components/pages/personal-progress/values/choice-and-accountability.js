        help in making personal decisions such as choosing good friends, being
        kind to others, getting up on time, or other decisions. Discuss with a
        parent or leader how regular scripture study and prayer helped you make
        correct decisions.

        Read the pamphlet{" "}

          For the Strength of Youth
        </a>. List in your journal each standard of righteous behavior the
        pamphlet outlines, and record why it is important to choose to live
        those standards. Practice living righteous standards by choosing three
        standards in which you need to improve. You might choose to be more
        selective about television, music, books, or other media, or you might
        improve your modesty, language, or honesty. After three weeks share your
        progress with your family, your class, or a leader.
