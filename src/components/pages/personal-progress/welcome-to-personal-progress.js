    <h2>Welcome To Personal Progress</h2>

    <p>
      You are a beloved daughter of Heavenly Father, prepared to come to the
      earth at this particular time for a sacred and glorious purpose. You have
      a noble responsibility to use your strength and influence for good. Your
      loving Heavenly Father has blessed you with talents and abilities that
      will help you fulfill your divine mission. As you learn to accept and act
      upon the Young Women values in your life, you will form personal habits of
      prayer, scripture study, obedience to the commandments, and service to
      others. These daily personal habits will strengthen your faith in and
      testimony of Jesus Christ. They will also allow you to recognize and
      develop your unique gifts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Always use your influence to lift and bless your family, other young
      women, and the young men with whom you associate. Honor womanhood, support
      the priesthood, and cherish faithful motherhood and fatherhood.
    </p>

    <p>
      As you participate in Personal Progress, you join with thousands of other
      young women who are striving to come unto Christ and “stand as witnesses
      of God at all times and in all things, and in all places” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18.9">
        Mosiah 18:9
      </a>). Counsel with your parents, and prayerfully choose goals that will
      help you cultivate feminine attributes, strengthen your testimony, and
      reach your divine potential. Take advantage of your time in Young Women by
      preparing to receive the sacred ordinances of the temple, to become a
      faithful wife and mother, and to strengthen your home and family.
