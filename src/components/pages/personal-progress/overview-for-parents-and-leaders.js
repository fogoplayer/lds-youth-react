    <h2>Overview For Parents And Leaders</h2>

    <h4>Purpose of Personal Progress</h4>

    <p>
      Young Women Personal Progress is an achievement program designed to help
      young women:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Strengthen their testimonies of Jesus Christ</li>
      <li>Strengthen both their present and future families.</li>
      <li>Prepare to be worthy to make and keep sacred temple covenants.</li>
      <li>Prepare for their future roles and responsibilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Young women work with their parents, Young Women leaders, and other
      exemplary women to set and accomplish goals based on the eight Young Women
      values. Personal Progress can help parents and leaders improve their
      relationship with young women as they work together.
    </p>

    <h4>Responsibilities of Parents and Young Women Leaders</h4>

    <h5>Introduce the Program</h5>
    <p>
      Young Women leaders meet with each young woman who enters the Young Women
      program and her parents. A member of the young woman's class presidency
      could also attend. The leaders present the young woman with a Young Women
      Personal Progress book, a Personal Progress journal, and the Young Women
      torch pendant. They explain the program to her and encourage parents to
      work with their daughter in selecting and completing Personal Progress
      experiences and projects. The leaders should also invite parents to all
      special events in which their daughter participates.
    </p>

    <h5>Ensure Adequate Support</h5>
    <p>
      A young woman needs support and regular encouragement in completing
      Personal Progress. This may come from parents, leaders, other adults, and
      older young women who have completed Personal Progress. If the young woman
      has limited support at home to assist her in completing Personal Progress,
      another sister may be invited to serve as a mentor and help her, in
      counsel with priesthood leaders. This adult sister may approve value
      experiences and projects and sign the young woman's Personal Progress book
      when they are completed. Another young woman who has completed Personal
      Progress may also be invited to give help and encouragement.
    </p>

    <h5>Record and Recognize Progress</h5>
    <p>
      Parents and leaders provide regular opportunities for young women to
      report their progress. When a young woman reports regularly, she is able
      to make an accounting of her efforts and share what she has learned and
      how her testimony has been strengthened. Parents and leaders recognize her
      accomplishments, confirm her understanding and application of gospel
      principles, and offer encouragement for continued progress. These
      interactions will help develop caring relationships.
    </p>

    <h4>Responsibilities of Priesthood Leaders</h4>

    <p>
      When a young woman completes the entire Personal Progress program, the
      bishop interviews her, using the standards in{" "}
      <a href="https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth">
        For the Strength of Youth
      </a>{" "}
      as a guide. He verifies her attendance at sacrament meeting, her
      participation in seminary, and her reading of the{" "}
      <a href="https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/">Book of Mormon</a>. This can be
      part of her annual or six-month interview. The bishop determines the
      worthiness of the young woman to receive the Young Womanhood Recognition
      and{" "}
      <a href="reccomendationForYoungWomanhoodRecognition.html">
        signs her Personal Progress book
      </a>{" "}
      to acknowledge her completion of the necessary requirements. He may
      present her with the Young Womanhood Recognition in a sacrament meeting or
      other meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      A young woman's success in Personal Progress may also be acknowledged as
      she receives her Beehive, Mia Maid, and Laurel certificates as she moves
      from class to class.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members of the bishopric may use their interviews with young women to
      recognize and encourage each young woman's progress. The Young Women
      Personal Progress Tracking Sheet for Leaders, maintained by the Young
      Women presidency, may be helpful in assisting bishopric members. Stake
      presidents should regularly ask bishops about the welfare and progress of
      the young women in their wards.
    </p>

    <h4>Guidelines</h4>

    <p>
      The goals and requirements of the program are outlined in the front of
      this book. The following additional guidelines may be helpful for leaders.
    </p>

    <h5>Value Experiences</h5>

    <p>A young woman may work on the values in any order.</p>
    <p>
      With the exception of the value of virtue, young women are encouraged to
      complete the required value experiences before doing the project for that
      value.
    </p>

    <h5>Value Projects</h5>

    <p>
      A value project is intended to help a young woman apply what she has
      learned from the value experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman should spend a minimum of ten hours for each value project.
      The same ten hours may not count for more than one value project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young women may work together on projects. However, a young woman must
      spend a minimum of ten hours of her own time if she is using that project
      to fulfill her own Personal Progress requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the prior approval of parents or Young Women leaders, the good things
      young women are doing at home, Church, school, seminary, and in the
      community may fulfill the requirements of Personal Progress.
    </p>

    <h5>Completing Personal Progress</h5>

    <p>
      When a young woman completes the Personal Progress requirements before
      leaving Young Women, she should be invited to help other young women who
      are still working on Personal Progress. She should also be encouraged to
      earn an Honor Bee or begin the program again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a young woman has not completed all of the Personal Progress
      requirements before leaving Young Women, she should be encouraged to
      continue working toward receiving the Young Womanhood Recognition.
      Mothers, leaders, and other exemplary women may be invited to support her
      in accomplishing this.
    </p>

    <h5>Tracking and Pacing</h5>

    <p>
      The <a href="recordSheet.html">Personal Progress Record Sheet</a>{" "}
      summarizes each young woman's work in Personal Progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Young Women Personal Progress Tracking Sheet for Leaders is also
      available as a separate sheet to assist leaders in tracking the progress
      of each young woman (36655). It can be used to assist both Young Women and
      priesthood leaders in working with and recognizing each young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young women may work at their own pace in the Personal Progress program;
      however, it is recommended that a young woman complete at least one value
      experience each month and one value project every six months (two a year).
      If she starts working when she enters Young Women at age 12 and continues
      at this suggested pace, she will finish when she is 16. She will then have
      two years to{" "}
      <a href="honorBee.html">earn an Honor Bee or begin the program again</a>.
    </p>

    <h5>Recognizing Individual Progress</h5>

    <p>
      When a young woman completes the experiences and projects for each value,
      she receives an emblem (36654) and the scripture ribbon associated with
      that value. She places the emblem on the Personal Progress Value
      Achievement page of her book (page 78). She uses the ribbon as a bookmark
      in her scriptures. This recognition of her progress can be awarded in a
      Young Women meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annually, at Young Women in Excellence, young women should be recognized
      for their accomplishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young woman's success in Personal Progress may also be acknowledged as
      she receives her Beehive, Mia Maid, and Laurel certificates as she moves
      from class to class. These certificates (Beehive, 08563; Mia Maid, 08565;
      Laurel, 08564) are awarded under the direction of the bishop. They
      acknowledge the young woman's movement from one age-group to another.
    </p>

    <h5>Young Womanhood Recognition</h5>

    <p>
      When a young woman completes her work in all eight values and has been
      interviewed by the bishop, she receives the Young Womanhood Recognition.
      This recognition consists of a certificate (36651) and a medallion in
      either gold or silver (gold, 08602; silver, 08603). A member of the
      bishopric may present the Young Womanhood Recognition in a sacrament
      meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the Young Womanhood Recognition, a young woman may
      continue to progress by earning an{" "}
      <a href="honorBee.html">Honor Bee charm</a> (gold, 08562; silver, 08578).
      This recognition of her progress can be awarded in a Young Women meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awards and certificates may be obtained through a Church distribution
      center using ward funds, at no cost to the young women or their parents.
    </p>

    <h4>Personal Progress Requirements for Leaders</h4>

    <p>
      Leaders are encouraged to work on Personal Progress along with the young
      women. Those who participate in the Personal Progress program themselves
      understand the program better and set a favorable example for the young
      women to follow. They may earn the Young Womanhood Recognition after they:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Serve for a total of one year as a Young Women leader.</li>
      <li>
        Complete the required value experiences in each of the eight values.
      </li>
      <li>Complete three value projects, including the project for virtue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Participation of Mothers</h4>

    <p>
      Mothers are welcome to participate with young women in earning the Young
      Womanhood Recognition. Mothers work from their own Personal Progress book
      and may earn the recognition along with their daughter. It is recommended
      that a daughter earn her recognition before or along with her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mothers may complete the same requirements as their daughters, including:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Attend sacrament meeting regularly (where possible).</li>
      <li>
        Live the standards in{" "}
        <a href="https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth">
          For the Strength of Youth
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the value experiences and value project for each of the eight
        values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep a <a href="myJournal.html">personal journal</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Read the <a href="https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/">Book of Mormon</a>{" "}
        regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="myTestimony.html">Record her testimony</a> of the Savior Jesus
        Christ.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Mothers may select different options for the elective value experiences
      and the value projects from their daughters. The experiences and projects
      may be signed and dated by their daughter, their spouse, a Young Women
      leader, or another adult. The bishop verifies that the requirements have
      been completed. Recognition and the purchase of recognition materials
      should be coordinated with Young Women leaders and the bishopric.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Personal Progress Requirements for Others Who Desire to Work on the
      Program
    </h4>

    <p>
      Other women who desire to participate in and complete Personal Progress
      may do so by completing the same requirements as young women and by
      assisting a young woman with a portion of her Personal Progress. (See
      requirements for mothers)
    </p>

    <h4>Incorporating Personal Progress in Sunday Lessons and at Mutual</h4>

    <p>
      Working together on a Personal Progress experience as part of a Sunday
      lesson can give leaders and young women an opportunity to discuss the
      principles being taught and their application in the lives of young women.
      References to Personal Progress can be found in Young Women curriculum
      materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      Personal Progress activities may also be part of Mutual. For example, all
      young women could assist with one young woman's value project. Working
      together on a project can help motivate young women to continue
      progressing. Such group activities should be planned prayerfully and
      selectively to ensure that the Personal Progress program remains personal
      for each young woman.
    </p>

    <h4>Adapting to Individual and Local Needs</h4>

    <p>
      Value experiences and value projects may be adapted according to personal
      or local circumstances, interests, and needs with prior approval of
      parents and leaders. When making any changes or exceptions for one person,
      leaders should consider the effect those changes may have on other young
      women. After careful consideration by parents and leaders, adaptations may
      be made to meet the needs of young women with disabilities or educational
      limitations, to meet cultural or individual needs, or to allow young women
      who are not members to participate.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a young woman joins the Church or becomes active in Young Women after
      age 16, her requirements for completing the Personal Progress program are
      to:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Attend sacrament meeting regularly (where possible).</li>
      <li>
        Live the standards in{" "}
        <a href="https://lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth">
          For the Strength of Youth
        </a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete the required value experiences in each of the eight values.
        (She need not complete the elective experiences.)
      </li>
      <li>Complete a value project in each of the eight values.</li>
      <li>Attend seminary (where available).</li>
      <li>
        Read the <a href="https://lds.org/scriptures/bofm/">Book of Mormon</a>{" "}
        regularly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="myTestimony.html">Record her testimony</a> of the Savior Jesus
        Christ.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These requirements may also apply to young women in other circumstances as
      determined by local Young Women leaders.
