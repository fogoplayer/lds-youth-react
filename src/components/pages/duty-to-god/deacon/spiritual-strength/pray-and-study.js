    <h2>Pray and Study the Scriptures</h2>
        
        <h4>Learn</h4>
        <p>Carefully study <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/josh/1.8">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.23-24">1 Nephi 15:23–24</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32.3">2 Nephi 32:3</a>; <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2-3">Alma 17:2–3</a>;
        and <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21.4-6">D&C 21:4–6</a>. As you study, make a
        list of words and phrases that describe:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>How you should approach your study of the scriptures
          and words of the living prophets.</li>
          <li> Blessings that will come as you study the scriptures and
          words of the living prophets.</li>
        </ol>
        <TextArea id="deaconSSScriptures1" />
        <p>Share your list with your parents, priesthood leaders, or
        other quorum members. Discuss specific blessings you have
        received from following counsel the Lord has given in the
        scriptures and through living prophets.</p>
        <p>In the next section, write your plans to begin or strengthen
        a habit of regular prayer and scripture study. For example,
        you could plan to study the Book of Mormon for a specific
        amount of time each day. Your scripture study could include
        the words of the living prophets in the conference issues of
        the Ensign or Liahona.</p>
        
        <h4>Act</h4>
        <p>My plan for developing a habit of regular prayer and scripture
        study:</p>
        <TextArea id="deaconSSScriptures2" />
        
        <h4>Share</h4>
        <p>Share what you are learning from your
        scripture study. For example, you
        could share with your family, with
        friends, or in quorum meetings. This
        will strengthen your testimony of what
        you’re learning and help you learn
        how to teach the gospel. It will also
        strengthen the testimony of others.</p>
