    <h2>For The Strength Of Youth: Physical Health</h2>

    <p>
      After you have begun working on your plans in “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/deacon/deaconSS.html">
        Spiritual Strength
      </a>” and “<a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/deacon/deaconPD.html">
        Priesthood Duties
      </a>,” create a project based on the standards in the “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/physical-and-emotional-health">
        Physical Health
      </a>” section of For the Strength of Youth. Use the steps on the following
      pages as a guide. Your project should be challenging and should include a
      signifi cant time commitment. It should be based on your own needs and
      interests. It should establish a pattern that will help you build and
      maintain physical health throughout your life.
    </p>

    <h4>Step One: Learn</h4>
    <p>
      Read “<a href="https://www.lds.org/youth/for-the-strength-of-youth/physical-and-emotional-health">
        Physical Health
      </a>” in For the Strength of Youth, and study the following scriptures:{" "}
      <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124">
        Doctrine and Covenants 88:124
      </a>,{" "}
      <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.124">
        Doctrine and Covenants 89
      </a>, and{" "}
      <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3.16-17">
        1 Corinthians 3:16–17
      </a>. Identify principles that relate to physical health. Write down your
      answers to the following questions, and share them with a parent, a
      priesthood leader, or quorum members:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Why is it important to be physically healthy? How will being physically
        healthy help you fulfill your priesthood duties (including as a
        missionary, as a father, and in your service to others)?
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the spiritual benefits of being physically healthy? What are
        the spiritual consequences of not caring for our physical bodies
        properly?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Step 2: Create a Project</h4>
    <p>
      Create a project that will help you apply what you have learned about
      physical health. It should include two parts: (1) regular exercise and (2)
      nutrition. Have a parent or leader approve your project before you begin
      working on it. Here are some examples of things you could include in each
      part of your project:
    </p>

    <h5>Examples-Regular Exercise</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a monthly exercise chart. Include a variety of exercises that
        help you become more physically fit, such as running, biking, or
        training for a sport.
      </li>
      <li>Learn and participate in a sport.</li>
      <li>
        Increase your capabilities in a physical activity you are already
        involved in.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Examples-Nutrition</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make a commitment to live the Word of Wisdom. Include in your
        commitment: (a) how you will avoid situations in which you may be
        tempted to violate this commitment and (b) how you will respond to
        temptations (for example, ways you might explain to others why you obey
        the Word of Wisdom).
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn principles of proper nutrition from{" "}
        <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89">
          Doctrine and Covenants 89
        </a>{" "}
        and from books, the Internet, or other sources. Teach your family or
        quorum what you discover. Keep a record of what you eat for a month, and
        then make changes to your diet based on what you have learned about
        nutrition.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn how to prepare three nutritionally balanced meals. Prepare them
        for your family.
      </li>
    </ol>
