    <h2>Message From the First Presidency</h2>

    <p>
      You live in a day of great opportunities and challengesâ€”a day in which the
      priesthood has been restored. You have the authority to administer the
      ordinances of the Aaronic Priesthood. As you prayerfully and worthily
      exercise that authority, you will greatly bless the lives of those around
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, along with the scriptures and For the Strength of Youth, will
      help you fulfill your responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavenly Father has great trust and confidence in you and has an important
      mission for you to fulfill. He will help you as you turn to Him in prayer,
      listen for the promptings of the Spirit, obey the commandments, and keep
      the covenants that you have made. You will feel a great sense of
      accomplishment as you fulfill your duties, and you will be prepared to
      receive the Melchizedek Priesthood, receive the covenants and ordinances
      of the temple, worthily serve a full-time mission, and become a righteous
      husband and father. May the Lord continue to bless you in these efforts.
