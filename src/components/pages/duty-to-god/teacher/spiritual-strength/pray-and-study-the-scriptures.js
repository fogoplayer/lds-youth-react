    <p>
      Think about your personal prayers. How often do you pray? How do you feel
      when you pray? Study

      and the blessings that will come as you “pray always.”

    <p>
      Carefully study{" "}
      <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.29-30">
        Helaman 3:29–30
      </a>{" "}

      As you study, look for words and phrases that describe:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        How you should approach your study of the scriptures and words of the
        living prophets.
      </li>
      <li>
        {" "}
        Blessings that will come as you study the scriptures and words of the
        living prophets.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the next section, write your plan to improve your personal prayers and
      scripture study during your years as a teacher. Your scripture study could
      include the words of the living prophets in the conference issues of the
      Ensign or Liahona.

    <TextArea id="text1" />

    <h4>Share</h4>
    <p>
      Share what you are learning from your scripture study. For example, you
      could share with your family, with friends, in seminary, or in quorum
      meetings. Try to make sharing what you are learning a regular practice.
      This will strengthen your testimony and help you learn how to teach the
      gospel. It will also strengthen the testimony of others.
