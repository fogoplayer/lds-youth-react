      <a href="/LDSYouth/dutyToGod/teacher/teacherPDInvite.html">plan</a> you
      made to become a good home teacher. Looking back on your home teaching

      Write your answers to the following questions, and discuss them with your
      parents or quorum members:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        How does your example affect your ability to teach the gospel to others?
      </li>
      <li>
        What can you do as a priest to teach the gospel through your actions as
        well as your words?
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Continue in your efforts to share the gospel. Think about family members
      and friends whom you could invite to come unto Christ. Write down their
      names and what you will do to help them. Include names of Aaronic
      Priesthood holders who arenâ€™t actively participating in the Church.
