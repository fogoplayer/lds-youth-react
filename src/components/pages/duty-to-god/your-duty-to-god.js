    <h2>Your Duty To God</h2>

    <p>
      You are a son of God. He has restored His priesthood in our day, and He
      has entrusted you with that priesthood. The purpose of this book is to
      help you:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Strengthen your testimony and your relationship with God.</li>
      <li>Learn and fulfill your priesthood duties.</li>
      <li>Apply standards from For the Strength of Youth.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The Lord has promised that as you fulfill your priesthood duties, you will
      be sanctified by the Spirit, you will become the elect of God, and
      eventually you will receive all that the Father has (see{" "}
      <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.33-48">
        D&C 84:33–38
      </a>). Your service as a priesthood holder will bring great blessings to
      those you serve.
    </p>

    <h4>Focus on What You Are Becoming</h4>

    <p>
      Fulfilling your duty to God is a lifelong experience. Don’t think of this
      book as a list of tasks that you must hurry through in order to earn an
      award. Instead, focus on how the activities you choose can help you
      develop spiritual attributes and become the kind of priesthood holder
      Heavenly Father wants you to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completing the activities in this book is not a requirement for advancing
      in the priesthood. The purpose of the activities is to help you prepare
      for priesthood service.
    </p>

    <h4>Learn, Act, Share</h4>

    <p>
      The Lord has commanded, “Let every man learn his duty, and to act in the
      offi ce in which he is appointed, in all diligence” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107.99">
        D&C 107:99
      </a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      As you diligently complete the activities in this book, you will have
      opportunities to learn your duties, make your own plans to fulfill them,
      and share your experiences with your parents and quorum members. Make
      plans that fit your interests and your needs. Make them challenging but
      also enjoyable. Focus on ways you can exercise the priesthood to be of
      service to others. By making and fulfilling your own plans, you will be
      taking responsibility for your own spiritual growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some of the learning activities, you will be invited to write your
      thoughts and feelings about what you are studying. Consider writing these
      things in a notebook or journal.
    </p>

    <h4>Recieving Help</h4>

    <p>
      The plans that you make in this book are personal, but your parents,
      quorum members, quorum president, and other Church leaders can help. For
      example, you can:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Ask for their help as you learn your duties and make your plans. Your
        quorum president, for example, holds priesthood keys for your quorum,
        and he has a responsibility to help you learn and fulfill your
        priesthood duties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share your experiences with them during interviews, quorum meetings and
        activities, and informal conversations. This will help you see the
        progress you are making and build your confidence in talking about the
        gospel. The things you share can also strengthen the testimonies of
        others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Invite your parents or quorum members to make plans too, and work on
        your plans together. When you work on your plans with someone else, you
        support and encourage one another.
      </li>
    </ol>
