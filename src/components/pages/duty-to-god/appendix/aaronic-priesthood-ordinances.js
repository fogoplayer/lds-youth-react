    <h2>Aaronic Priesthood Ordinances</h2>

    <h4>Blessing the Sacrament</h4>
    <p>
      Priests bless the sacramental bread using these words: “O God, the Eternal
      Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and
      sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they
      may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O
      God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name
      of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has
      given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them. Amen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77">
        D&C 20:77
      </a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      They bless the water using these words: “O God, the Eternal Father, we ask
      thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this
      [water] to the souls of all those who drink of it, that they may do it in
      remembrance of the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they
      may witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always
      remember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. Amen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.79">
        D&C 20:79
      </a>).
    </p>

    <h4>Performing a Baptism</h4>
    <p>
      Under the direction of the presiding authority, a priest may perform the
      ordinance of baptism. To do so, he:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Stands in the water with the person to be baptized.</li>
      <li>
        Holds the person’s right wrist with his left hand (for convenience and
        safety); the person who is being baptized holds the priesthood holder’s
        left wrist with his or her left hand.
      </li>
      <li>Raises his right arm to the square.</li>
      <li>
        States the person’s full name and says, “Having been commissioned of
        Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
        and of the Holy Ghost. Amen” (<a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.73">
          D&C 20:73
        </a>).
      </li>
      <li>
        Has the person hold his or her nose with the right hand (for
        convenience); then the priesthood holder places his right hand high on
        the person’s back and immerses the person completely, including the
        person’s clothing.
      </li>
      <li>Helps the person come up out of the water.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Conferring the Aaronic Priesthood and Ordaining to an Office</h4>
    <p>
      When authorized by the presiding authority, a priest may confer the
      Aaronic Priesthood and ordain a person to an office in the Aaronic
      Priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      To perform a priesthood ordination, one or more authorized priesthood
      holders place their hands lightly on the person’s head. Then the person
      who performs the ordination:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Calls the person by his full name.</li>
      <li>
        States the authority by which the ordination is performed (Aaronic or
        Melchizedek Priesthood).
      </li>
      <li>
        Confers the Aaronic Priesthood, unless it has already been conferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ordains the person to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood (deacon,
        teacher, or priest) and bestows the rights, powers, and authority of
        that office. (Priesthood keys are not bestowed in conferring the
        priesthood or ordaining to one of these offices.)
      </li>
      <li>Gives words of blessing as the Spirit directs.</li>
      <li>Closes in the Name of Jesus Christ.</li>
    </ol>
