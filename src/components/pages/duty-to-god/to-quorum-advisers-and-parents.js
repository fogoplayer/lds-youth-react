    <h2>To Advisers and Parents</h2>

    <p>
      The Duty to God program is a tool to help Aaronic Priesthood holders
      strengthen their testimony and their relationship with Heavenly Father,
      learn about and fulfill their priesthood duties, and apply the standards
      from For the Strength of Youth. The instructions in this section outline
      your role in helping young men fulfill these purposes. You can find
      additional instructions, along with an interactive version of this book,
      at <a href="https://www.dutytogod.lds.org">dutytogod.lds.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Focus On What They Are Becoming</h4>
    <p>
      Fulfilling our duty to God is a lifelong experience. For this reason, the
      Duty to God book should not be seen as a list of tasks that the young men
      must hurry through in order to earn an award. Help the young men focus
      instead on how the plans they make can help them develop spiritual
      attributes and become the kind of priesthood holders God wants them to be.
    </p>

    <h4>Help the Young Men</h4>
    <h5>Learn</h5>
    <p>
      <b>The purpose of the “Learn” section. </b>Each part of this book begins
      with a learning activity that helps the young men learn what Heavenly
      Father wants them to do and why it is important. When a young man knows
      the “why” behind his priesthood duties, the Holy Ghost inspires him to
      act, and his actions can increase his faith and testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>When to help young men with the learning activities. </b>Young men
      should learn their priesthood duties soon after they are ordained to a
      priesthood office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advisers, consider making time for the young men to work on the learning
      activities together as a quorum. For example, you could do this during
      quorum meeting or Mutual. You could assign the young men to work on a
      learning activity on their own and report on it during a quorum meeting.
      Counseling together as a quorum about priesthood duties, spiritual
      strength, and the Lord’s standards will build quorum unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents, consider working on the learning activities with your son soon
      after he is ordained to a priesthood office. Ask your son to share with
      you what he is learning about fulfilling his duty to God
    </p>

    <h5>Act</h5>
    <p>
      <b>The purpose of the “Act” section. </b>After completing the learning
      activity, the young men are encouraged to make plans to fulfill their
      priesthood duties and increase their spiritual strength. Making their own
      plans allows young men to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Exercise their agency.</li>
      <li>Adapt the activities to their individual circumstances.</li>
      <li>Develop spiritual self-reliance.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <b>When to help the young men make their plans. </b>Some young men may
      need guidance in making their plans. Advisers, consider making time for
      young men to counsel together as a quorum as they write their individual
      plans. For example, you could do this during quorum meeting or Mutual. Or
      you could invite the young men to write their plans on their own or with
      their parents and share their plans during a quorum meeting. Either way,
      encourage them to share their plans with their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the young men counsel together as a quorum about their plans, they give
      each other ideas and support. Likewise, parents can give their sons ideas
      and support as they make their plans. By sharing their plans with quorum
      members and parents, young men strengthen their commitment to fulfill
      those plans. Some plans can be made and carried out as a quorum or as a
      family.
    </p>

    <h5>Share</h5>
    <p>
      <b>The purpose of the “Share” section. </b>Once the young men have worked
      on their plans for a period of time, they are encouraged to talk with
      others about their experiences. Sharing their experiences will:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Strengthen their testimonies and their understanding of the gospel.
      </li>
      <li>Allow them to see the progress they are making.</li>
      <li>
        Increase their confidence and ability to talk about gospel truths.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Young men may be uncomfortable sharing at first, but the more
      opportunities they have to do it, the more comfortable they will feel.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>When to help young men share their experiences. </b>Advisers, consider
      making time for young men to share with quorum members the experiences
      they are having as they fulfill their plans. For example, during the first
      few minutes of quorum meeting the quorum president could invite the young
      men to talk about what they are learning as they fulfill their plan to
      study the scriptures regularly (see Pray and Study the Scriptures for{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/deacon/pray-and-study-the-scriptures">deacon</Link>,{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/teacher/pray-and-study-the-scriptures">
        teacher
      </Link>, and{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/priest/pray-and-study-the-scriptures">priest</Link>).
      Or he could invite them to share an experience they had serving others
      (see Serve Others for{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/deacon/priesthood-duties/serve-others">
        deacon
      </Link>,{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/teacher/priesthood-duties/serve-others">
        teacher
      </Link>, and{" "}
      <Link to="/duty-to-god/priest/priesthood-duties/serve-others">
        priest
      </Link>). Hearing about the experiences their fellow quorum members are
      having reminds young men of their own plans and encourages them to have
      experiences of their own. Encourage the young men to discuss their plans
      and experiences with their parents also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents, ask your son to discuss with you what he is learning and the
      experiences he is having. This will help him see the progress he is
      making.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Conversations along the way. </b>Young men often gain more from gospel
      conversations than they do from hearing lectures about the gospel. Take
      advantage of every opportunity to let the young men talk about their
      experiences. Sharing is not something the young men do once, and it does
      not represent the completion of their plan. It does not need to be done in
      a formal setting; it can be most effective in informal conversations
      during quorum activities, with friends, and with family members.
    </p>

    <h5>For The Strength of Youth</h5>
    <p>
      After the young men have begun working on their plans in “Spiritual
      Strength” and “Priesthood Duties,” they have the opportunity to create a
      project based on some of the standards in For the Strength of Youth.
      Priests are invited to create an additional project to help them prepare
      to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood and serve a full-time mission. The
      young men should have a parent or leader approve their project before they
      begin. You can help them create a project that is challenging but also
      based on their needs and interests.
    </p>

    <h4>Review Their Progress</h4>
    <p>
      The best way to help a young man see the progress he is making is to have
      frequent conversations with him about his plans and his experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least one of these conversations should happen as the young man
      approaches the age to be ordained to an office in the priesthood. During
      this conversation, ask him to review the plans he made as a deacon,
      teacher, or priest. Talk about how fulfilling those plans has helped him
      prepare for the additional priesthood duties he is about to receive. This
      is an opportunity to help the young man reflect on the kind of priesthood
      holder he is becoming. At the end of each “Spiritual Strength” and
      “Priesthood Duties” section is a “Review” section. Here you and the young
      man can indicate with your signatures that you have had this conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Completing the activities in this book is not a requirement for advancing
      in the priesthood. The purpose of the activities is to help young men
      prepare for priesthood service.
    </p>

    <h4>Duty to God Certificates</h4>
    <p>
      After you have completed the “Review” sections, and after the young man
      has completed his “For the Strength of Youth” project, he is eligible to
      receive a Duty to God certificate. Three certificates are available: one
      each for deacons (item number 08686), teachers (08687), and priests
      (08688). These certificates acknowledge the progress the young man is
      making toward fulfilling his duty to God. To receive the priest
      certificate, the young man must also complete his project in the section
      titled “Preparing to Receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.” It is not
      necessary that he receive the deacon and teacher certificates in order to
      receive the priest certificate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The certificates are awarded under the direction of the bishop. An
      optional plaque for displaying the priest certificate is also available
      (08694).
    </p>

    <h4>Use the Duty To God Program To Strengthen The Quorum</h4>
    <p>The Duty to God program strengthens the quorum by: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Helping quorum members understand their duty to God. </b> For
        example, you can help quorum members understand their duties by having
        them complete the learning activities in this book as a quorum.
        Counseling together about priesthood duties and spiritual growth can
        broaden their understanding and inspire them to act.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Providing opportunities for quorum members to work together in
          fulfilling priesthood duties.{" "}
        </b>In some cases, quorum members can counsel together to make their
        plans, and they can carry out their plans together. Doing this allows
        them to support and encourage each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Encouraging quorum members to share ideas and experiences. </b> Some
        of the younger quorum members may have difficulty thinking of plans;
        sharing ideas as a quorum can help generate more ideas. Sharing
        experiences with quorum members can help build faith, testimony, and
        quorum brotherhood. Consider doing this regularly during quorum meetings
        and activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>
          Providing the quorum president the opportunity to lead by example.{" "}
        </b>When a young man joins the quorum, the quorum president could use
        the Duty to God book to help the new quorum member understand his
        duties. The quorum president could also share with the quorum the plans
        he has made in his own book and tell about his experiences carrying out
        those plans.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Helping quorum members learn the importance of priesthood keys.</b>{" "}
        The quorum president holds the keys of presidency for his quorum (see{" "}
        <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.142-143">
          D&C 124:142–43
        </a>). Quorum advisers should allow him the opportunity to exercise
        those keys. As young men serve together under the direction of the
        quorum president, they can grow in their understanding of how the Lord
        works through priesthood leaders. They can see that a quorum is a
        divinely appointed organization that gives them opportunities to learn
        their priesthood duties, give priesthood service, and grow spiritually.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Use the Duty To God Program to Strengthen Relationships</h4>
    <p>
      When you have a strong relationship with your son or the young men in your
      quorum, they are more likely to deepen their conversion to the gospel and
      remain faithful. The activities in the Duty to God book provide an
      excellent opportunity to strengthen these relationships. For example,
      making your own plans and working on them with your son or a quorum member
      could allow you to spend time together engaged in meaningful activities.
      Sharing experiences with each other gives you the opportunity to bear
      testimony and strengthen each other spiritually
